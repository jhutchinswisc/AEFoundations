### Foundations of Agricultural Economics, AAE 641

**Instructor**: Brent Hueth

**Office Hours**: By appointment

#### Course Description

I provide perspective on broad countours of the food and agricultural economics
field, including its historical development and current active research themes.
I highlight economic and policy interactions that connect the field to related
development, environment, and health fields within economics. The course also
provides students an introduction to applied research methodology with ample
opportunity to conduct hands-on data analysis, and to explore the the varied
research strategies used by economists and other social scientists. In class, I
split time between discussion and problem solving. All discussion will,
however, be directed toward specific questions for which I will ask students to
prepare written responses. Likewise, problems require a mix of analytic
derivation, data analysis, writing, and presentation.

#### Learning Objectives

1. Develop an appreciation for the historical antecedents and contemporary
   status of food and agricultural economics as a field, and for the full range
   of economic and policy interactions among related development,
   environmental, and health fields.
1. Learn how to read academic papers critically: identify key assumptions,
   evaluate relevance and robustness of stated results, and assess extent of
   contribution in light of previous related work.
1. Gain a sense for the art of building simple mathematical models as aids to
   understanding social and economic behavior.
1. Appreciate the difference between a stylized economic model and a
   well-specified empirical model to be used for measurement, model testing,
   and policy analysis.
1. Understand the role of economic models as a source of identification in
   empirical models, and their value for conducting counterfactual policy
   analysis.
1. Develop best practice for conducting applied research using modern
   analytical, computing, data processing, version control, and publishing
   tools.

#### Assignments and Grading

- I will distribute at least one homework assignment per topic module.
- You will identify and replicate the results of one published research paper
  that is relevant to the theme of this course, and prepare a written report.
- I will ask you to prepare responses to questions I ask in anticipation of
  classroom discussion of published research.

Each of these assignments will carry roughly equal weight when I assign grades for the class. There will be no exams.
