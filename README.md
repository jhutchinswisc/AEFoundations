### Foundations of Agricultural Economics, AAE 641

**Instructor**: Brent Hueth  
**Email**: hueth@wisc.edu  
**Office Hours**: By appointment

#### Course Description

In this course I provide perspective on broad countours of the food and
agricultural economics field, including its historical development and current
active research themes. I highlight economic and policy interactions that
connects the field to related development, environment, and health fields
within economics. The class also provides students an introduction to applied
research methodology with hands on data analysis and discussion of the varied
research strategies used by economists and other social scientists. In class, I
split time between discussion and problem solving. All discussion will,
however, be directed toward specific questions for which I will ask students to
prepare written responses. Likewise, problems require a mix of analytic
derivation, data analysis, writing, and presentation.

#### Learning Objectives

1. Develop an appreciation for the historical development and contemporary
   status of food and agricultural economics as a field, and for the full range
   of economic and policy interactions among related development,
   environmental, and health fields.
g1. Learn how to read academic papers critically: identify key assumptions,
   evaluate relevance and robustness of stated results, and assess extent of
   contribution in light of previous related work.
1. Gain a sense for the art of building simple mathematical models as aids to
   understanding social and economic behavior.
1. Appreciate the difference between a stylized economic model and a
   well-specified empirical model to be used for measurement, model testing,
   and policy analysis.
1. Understand the role of economic models as a source of identification in
   empirical models, and their value for conducting counterfactual policy
   analysis.
1. Develop best practice for conducting applied research using modern
   analytical, computing, data processing, version control, and publishing
   tools.
