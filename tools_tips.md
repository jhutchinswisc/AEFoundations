### Tools

You will take courses from many professors while you here at the University of
Wisconsin--Madison. Each will have their own style and toolkit for conducting
applied research. It is up to you to decide what mix of tools best suites your
needs, but in my experience you will do yourself a favor by investing now in
learning *well* a few high-quality computational, version control, and writing
tools. See [here](http://brenthueth.net/post/100824459208/writing-tools) for a discussion of writing tools. 

Here are a few pointers to computation and version-control resources:

- Git: This definitely requires an investment and involves some overhead, but I
  think the long-run payoffs can be significant. Aside from the tremendous
  functionality it provides for collaboration and reproducibility, you will
  benefit from using is yourself as a project-specific research notebook.
  [Here](http://nyuccl.org/pages/GitTutorial/) is a gentle introduction with
  good links to additional resources.
- Python/IPython: For this, I will direct you to the [Quantitative
  Economics](http://quant-econ.net/py/index.html) page developed and maintained
  by Tom Sargent and John Stachurski, and to [a gallery of interesting IPytyhon
  Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks). There is no reason to code a complex estimation alogrithm
  that someone else has already coded, in which case occasionally you may want
  want to use [R](http://www.r-project.org/). But for day-to-day computation,
  data handling, simulation or calibration, and estimation, you have all that
  you need in Python and friends.
- Reproducability: Except in experiments, we cannot "replicate" scientific
  findings in the usual sense, but we should at least be able to *reproduce*
  each other's results using exactly the same data! That's why we need
  organizations like the [Open Economics Working
  Group](http://openeconomics.net/), and the [Replication in Economics
  Wiki](http://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).
- Experiments are increasingly used by economists for applied research, market
  design, and teaching. We will not cover experimental methods in this course, though we will discuss several experimental papers. [Otree](http://www.otree.org/) is a great new tool (writtin in Python, of course!) for conducting experiments.

### Miscellaneneous Tips from Around the Web

- Often the hardest to part to writing a research paper is the introduction.
  Don Fullerton provides [a
  template](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35757123/writing-general.pdf)
  (scroll down a bin the document for the Introduction-specific instructions)
  for structuring your introduction that works remarkably well. I suggest that
  for your first few research papers you follow this formula.
- The importance of writing well in economics cannot be overemhpasized.
  Searching Google for "writing economics" turns up a whole host of great
  resources. I recommend that you take some time to read through some of these,
  and that you internalize their words of wisdom. I aslo highly recommend
  reading several times, [McCloskey's "Writing of Economics."](http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Economics-Donald-McCloskey/dp/0023795204) I also recommend his Economic Inquiry article, "Economical Writing" that you can find in our class
  Zotero library.
